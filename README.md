# AKONA CIKO: Agricultural _Dataset _Project

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The "Carbon Dioxide Emission from Agricultural Sector" project aims to analyse & quantify CO2 emissions generated by various agricultural activities. This dataset provides insights into the environmental impact of agriculture on climate change, focusing on key emission sources such as crop production, livestock, and energy use in the agric-food sector. The analysis will support environmental consultants, policymakers, and agricultural businesses in developing sustainable strategies for emission reduction. By identifying trends and evaluating emission patterns, the project will contribute to creating actionable recommendations to migitate the agricultural sector's carbon footprint while balancing food production demands.

### Key Findings:
Key Emission Sources _Fertilizer manufacturing, forest fires, and food transport emerged as significant contributors to CO₂ emissions in the agricultural sector.

Geographical Variations _High emission levels were observed in regions with intense agricultural activities, particularly in Asia and South America.

Trends Over Time _The data indicates an upward trend in emissions over recent years, suggesting a need for stronger environmental controls and sustainable practices.

### Dataset details:
The dataset used in this analysis was collected from an authorized source (co2_emissions_from_agri.csv), this dataset provides a valuable resource for environmental consultants, analysts, policymakers, agricultural businesses and enthusiasts interested in understanding the effect of CO2 emissions on climate change from the agri-food sector.
